Legislation concerning crop plants are among the most inconvenient region. The standards of Intellectual Property Rights specify that an intention can 
be secured as one IP. With the plants, the circumstance is muddled by genuinely covering sorts of IP: regular patents and Plant Breeders Right without 
compromising the privileges of Farmers. That particular arrangement for Intellectual Property assurance of new plant assortments presented in the TRIPS 
understanding made it required of the individuals from WTO to define legitimate measures either as licenses or a viable sui generis framework or blend 
of both to secure plant assortments. India was one of the principal nations in the world to have developed PBR enactment that all the while allowed 
rights to both farmers and breeders. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001,(PPVFR) builds up an extraordinary framework by 
broadening the idea of Plant Breeders Rights(PBRs), which is applied to new assortments of farmers, to assortments held by farmers and public-sector 
institutions. While the Act is based on the important principle of distributing ownership rights through the provision of benefit sharing and 
recognition and reward from the National Gene Fund, it has been instrumental in the acceleration of agricultural development; encouraging innovation, 
development investments in public and private plant breeding through the tests for distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS) in highly precise 
cultivation conditions. The PPVFR Authority, however, takes public awareness system of plant variety protection by providing information on the website, 
publication and distribution of information, organizing national seminars and maintenance of electronic databases containing national variety register. 
The registration shall be valid for nine years for trees and vines and six years for other crops which may be renewed for eighteen years for trees and 
vines and fifteen years for others from the date of registration.
