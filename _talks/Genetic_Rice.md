The worldâ€™s population is increasing alarmingly, accounting for about 8.6 billion by mid 2030.
The growing population has brought limitation in land use, resulting in rampant environmental
degradation bringing down natural ecosystem and resulting in climate change and food insecurity
and poverty. Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world&#39;s population. However, the
increasing temperature and drought have affected the crop production adversely around the
world. The idea of smart mutant plants could be a boon in this regard bringing a solution for food
insecurity and poverty. In plant breeding programs, mutation breeding is one of the oldest
methods. Currently, mutation breeding has become popular among the breeders and scientists.
Genetic variation is the sole aim in this technique and plant breeders are focused to, the
recombination and independent assortment of alleles, to obtain new individuals from the
population. IR64 is a mega rice variety known for higher yield, early maturity and disease
resistance but susceptible to drought stress, resulting in considerable yield reductions. The
desired characteristics of high yield under the stressed condition in IR64 can be brought through
exposing the variety to mutation breeding approach is discussed in this article.
