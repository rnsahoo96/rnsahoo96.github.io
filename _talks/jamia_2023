7.8 billion people and 8.7 million species need a peaceful, healthy world—one where we can live in safety and access the food and resources we need to survive. But all of that depends on the Arctic Ocean. For millions of years, the Arctic Ocean has been our planet’s air conditioning system. It regulates the atmospheric currents, ocean currents, and weather patterns that sustain our lives. But it has changed drastically in the past decades. Today, there is 75% less Arctic sea ice in the summer than there was just 50 years ago. As a result, the world’s weather patterns have become unstable with greater floods, fires, droughts, and other natural disasters—leading to displacement, unrest, and water and hunger crises. At the same time, military and commercial interests are taking advantage of the Arctic Ocean in its vulnerable state and doing even more damage. This is an underreported global emergency. In this virtual presentation, attendees will learn about the current dire state of Arctic Ocean exploitation and militarization, and the global consequences—as well as the singular opportunity presented by the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary (MAPS). As the largest marine preserve in history, MAPS is a critical and urgently needed response. [View Poster](https://rnsahoo96.github.io/files/SOAWAL_CE_29_1.pdf)
