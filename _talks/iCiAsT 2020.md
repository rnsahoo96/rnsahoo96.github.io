Nature presents a priceless endowment to mankind, wherein plants serve as the fundamental basis for the sustenance of life. The dependence of human beings on plants is deeply ingrained and goes beyond mere survival, extensively impacting our daily needs and cultural customs. The uniqueness of cultural traditions among particular groups is due to the diverse environmental circumstances they experience during migration, thereby shaping their practices through experimentation and experimentation. Modern societies have had a negative impact on traditional cultures and practices, leading to the erosion of their authenticity. However, the connection between faith, religion, and plants has emerged as a significant way to protect these valuable cultural and natural assets. Recent research has confirmed the scientific validity of ancient practices, promoting the sustainable use of plants for the betterment of the environment. In various regions, including India, ancestors associated specific plants with gods and goddesses, designating them as sacred. This highlights that while knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants may have declined, these practices still exist within religious and cultural contexts. This study aims to investigate the traditional and botanical aspects of selected plants that have become essential to our culture, providing a sacred route for conserving both nature and heritage.
