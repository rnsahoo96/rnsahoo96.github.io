Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by genus _Plasmodium_, is prevalent in Africa, leading to a significant number of deaths. This study focuses on the antiplasmodial properties of the Euphorbiaceae family, specifically the Croton genus, known for its medicinal benefits and widely used in Africa, Southern America, and Asia. In vivo experiments on mice revealed the antiplasmodial activity of Croton speciesâ€™ root, leaves, and fruit extracts. Notably, _C. macrostachyus_ Hocsht and _C. zembesicus_ leaf and root extracts are rich in alkaloids and terpenoid derivatives such as sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. The forthcoming chapter underscores the potential of _Croton_ genus as a natural remedy against malaria.
