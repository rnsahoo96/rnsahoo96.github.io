title: "Antimalarial response,traditional and other potential uses of _Croton _genera"
excerpt: "The research focused on exploring the uncharted biodiversity of the Himalayas, where **19 medicinal plant species** were **identified for their novel or lesser-known ethnomedicinal applications**. Additionally, **3 threatened wild plant species** were collected from the study area. The research also examined the sustainable lifestyle of native tribes and locals who utilized these medicinal plants to treat various ailments. The study underscored the immense potential of medicinal plants as a source of raw materials for the discovery of new bioactive compounds and drugs. We collected a **total of 102 plant samples**, which were subsequently preserved for herbarium preparation through numerous treks and forest expeditions.The maximum number of species belongs to the family Lamiaceae (7), Fabaceae (7), Asteraceae (6), Moraceae (4 species), Apocyanaceae (4 species) and Euphorbiaceae (3 species). Different plant parts were used by local informants such as leaves, galls, fruits, seeds, latex, stem, root, flowers, bark, and rhizomes. In addition to the aforementioned findings, the study also revealed that the majority of plant species were employed in the treatment of gastro-intestinal disorders (48 species), followed by skin disorders (34 species) and respiratory disorders (25 species). Furthermore, we conducted direct interviews with 77 traditional healers, tribes, and locals to understand their usage of medicinal plants in disease treatment. This comprehensive approach provided valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of Himalayan flora. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
