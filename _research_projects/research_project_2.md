title: " Delineating the potential of root phenotypic and physiological attributes of wheat genotypes under stress conditions"
excerpt: "Root, an often-overlooked component of plants, has recently garnered significant attention in research due to challenges in global food security caused by climate change. Despite the focus on above ground traits since the green revolution, progress has plateaued. To address this issue, the current research aims to explore the root's architectural and behavioral responses to abiotic stress-induced adversities. The study aimed to investigate the role of roots in Bread and Durum wheat in mediating abiotic stress resilience such as NaCl (100mM) and heavy metal (La), utilizing plant growth regulators such as ethylene (ET), dopamine (D), and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) across a diverse set of 50 wheat genotypes. Through this study, novel insights were gained, including significant phenotypic variation in wheat varieties in terms of total root length, seminal root angle, root area, and root volume. Furthermore, the finding of low Na+ accumulation, enhanced K+/Na+ discrimination, and significant variation in total phenol content, total flavonoid content, and nitric oxide contents were observed. <br/><img src='/images/msc dissertn.png'>"
