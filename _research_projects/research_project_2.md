title: "Ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological survey of indigenous medicinal plants of Palampur, Himachal Pradesh in North‑Western Himalaya, India"
excerpt: "The research focused on exploring the uncharted biodiversity of the Himalayas, where 19 medicinal plant species were identified for their novel or lesser-known ethnomedicinal applications. Additionally, three threatened wild plant species were collected from the study area. The research also examined the sustainable lifestyle of native tribes and locals who utilized these medicinal plants to treat various ailments. The study underscored the immense potential of medicinal plants as a source of raw materials for the discovery of new bioactive compounds and drugs. We collected a total of 102 plant samples, which were subsequently preserved for herbarium preparation through numerous treks and forest expeditions. Furthermore, we conducted interviews with many traditional healers, tribes, and locals to understand their usage of medicinal plants in disease treatment. This comprehensive approach provided valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of Himalayan flora. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
