title: " Delineating the potential of root phenotypic and physiological attributes of wheat genotypes under stress conditions"
excerpt: "Root, an often-overlooked component of plants, has recently garnered significant attention in research due to challenges in global food security caused by climate change. Despite the focus on above ground traits since the green revolution, progress has plateaued. To address this issue, the current research aims to explore the root's architectural and behavioral responses to abiotic stress-induced adversities. This will be achieved through the use of plant growth stimulators such as ethylene (ET), dopamine (D), and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) across a diverse set of 50 wheat genotypes. The study work aimed to investigate the role of roots in Bread and Durum wheat in mediating abiotic stress resilience such as NaCl (100mM) and heavy metal (La), utilizing plant growth regulators including ET, D, and AVG. Through this study, novel insights were gained, including significant phenotypic variation for salt tolerance in a set of 49 wheat varieties in terms of total root length, seminal root angle, root area, and root volume. Furthermore, the finding of low Na+ accumulation, enhanced K+/Na+ discrimination, and significant variation in total phenol content, total flavonoid content, and nitric oxide contents confirmed V1 (DDW 47) as the most salt-tolerant and V49 (C 306) as the most salt-sensitive variety with an observed root tolerance index. The study yields fresh insights and calls for further investigation into the potential of rare earth element (Lanthanum), in combination with abscisic acid, which is demonstrated as a positive regulator of root architectural growth and calcium concentration as La acts as a classical Ca2+ blocker. Additionally, the study illuminates the antagonistic impact of AVG on root architectural growth, biochemical contents, and signaling molecules such as nitric oxide. Significantly, the research on the interplay between salt stress (NaCl) and tunicamycin-induced ER stress revealed a lethal effect on root architectural traits and K+ content, while the impact of increased Na+ content on wheat plant immunity was a novel perspective explored in the study. Furthermore, dopamine at a concentration of 100 μM exhibited positive effects on root architectural traits after 16 hours, in contrast to 100 μM concentration at 24 hours. The efficacy of dopamine, a water-soluble antioxidant, may be attributed to its robust antioxidant properties and the capacity of dopamine oxidation to generate melanin, which can eliminate free radicals. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
