title: "Mutation breeding in case of Rice (IR64) variety through forward genetics approach"
excerpt: "Rice is one of the major staples of world and particularly India. The changing climate scenarios had resulted in huge crop losses to farmers, affecting nation as a whole. My research work in JNU primarily focused on creating climate resilient rice (IR64), one of the popular varieties in India, through mutation breeding via forward genetics approach. During my work we identified prospective IR64 (5000 mutant lines) lines with desirable phenotypes, that would adapt to dynamic climate scenarios without any loss in yield. Moreover, it requires further NGS (Next gen sequencing) for identification of particular genes responsible for resiliency in IR64 lines. Altogether, on a broad scale the research was pioneering in terms of establishing food security, eliminating hunger and poverty, establishing sustainable development goals.<br/><img src='/images/IR64.png'>"
