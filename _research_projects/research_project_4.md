Gastric cancer is a highly prevalent and aggressive malignant neoplasm, with the fifth highest incidence and fourth highest prevalence in the world. Conventional remedies for advanced stages of the ailment comprise surgical procedures, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy, which often causes severe side effects. The potency of these interventions has the potential to be improved by the inclusion of natural components. The forthcoming study endeavors to explore the potential of natural products and underlying molecular mechanisms in the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer from a therapeutic perspective.
