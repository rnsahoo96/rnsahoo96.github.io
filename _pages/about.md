Welcome! **I am a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), working on isolating and characterizing rhizobia from nodules of chickpea (_Cicer arietinum_ L.) in Dr. Sinharoy’s Lab.** My goal is to identify beneficial rhizobia and prepare a tailor-made rhizobial inoculant for chickpea after evaluating nitrogen fixation to improve symbiotic efficiency. I am also working on developing super-rhizobial strains and genome sequencing of the mother and adopted strains.
**I hold a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Botany from Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, where I worked to delineate the potential of root phenotypic and physiological attributes of wheat genotypes under stress conditions as a postgraduate dissertation student, advised by Dr. M. Iqbal R. Khan.** Additionally, I have a Postgraduate Diploma in Intellectual Property Rights (PGDIPR) from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), New Delhi, and a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Life Science at Ramjas College, University of Delhi.
**I am eager to pursue a fully funded Ph.D. in plant-microbe interaction and its ecophysiology.** My interest in this field has been shaped by my experience in plant stress physiology and Molecular Biology, Ethnobotany and Ethnopharmacology, Natural Resource Management, and Root stress physiology.**I am fascinated by the hidden half of the plant, 'the root,’ its ecophysiology, and beneficial interactions with microbes. I believe that exploring this relationship could pave the way for a second green revolution, establishing food security and sustainable agricultural practices with less or no dependence on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.**
During my free time, I enjoy cooking, cycling, reading, running, web series, travelling, and volunteering.
