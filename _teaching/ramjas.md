I trained Class 9 students of Amar Singh Inter College in Lakhaoti, Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh on ‘Hands-on training on Various Scientific Aspects Related to Biology’ in March 2019. I delivered engaging and interactive sessions to enhance students’ understanding of biological concepts and inspire their interest in the subject as part of an Outreach program, organized by Department of Botany, Ramjas College, University of Delhi, Delhi.
