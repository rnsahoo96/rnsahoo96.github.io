I have provided personalized tutoring to students in classes 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10 in Sciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences, and English for a period of 2.2 years from December 2020 to February 2023. I utilized innovative teaching methods to enhance studentsâ€™ understanding and improve their academic performance.
